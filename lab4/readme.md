# Lab 4 - Sound & Light Signal Generation

Generation of periodic audio and visual signals using parallel ports on ATmega128A.

## Objective

Program procedures for generating periodic sound and light signals.

## Hardware Configuration

- **Audio**: Buzzer connected to PORTB bit 4
- **Visual**: RGB LED connected to PORTE bits 3,4,5
- **Amplifiers**: Transistors for power amplification
- **Sound**: Dynamic speaker for audio output

## ðŸ“‹ Lab Tasks

- Generate Morse code signals for text output
- Implement different frequencies for audio signals
- Control RGB LED colors for visual feedback
- Create timing for dots, dashes, and pauses
- Infinite loop with 5-second pauses between sequences
